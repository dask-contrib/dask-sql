            description: |
              Whether or not to check partition length when computing a LIMIT without an OFFSET;
              checking partition length triggers a Dask graph computation which can be slow for
              complex queries, but can signicantly reduce memory usage when querying a small subset
              of a large table. Default is ``true``.

      predicate_pushdown:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether to try pushing down filter predicates into IO (when possible).
