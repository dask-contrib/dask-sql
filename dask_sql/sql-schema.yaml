        properties:

          split_out:
            type: integer
            description: |
              Number of output partitions from an aggregation operation

          split_every:
            type: [integer, "null"]
            description: |
              Number of branches per reduction step from an aggregation operation.

      identifier:

          case_sensitive:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Whether sql identifiers are considered case sensitive while parsing.

      join:

        properties:

          broadcast:
            type: [boolean, number, "null"]
            description: |
              If boolean, it determines whether all joins should use the broadcast join algorithm.
              If float, it's a value denoting dask's likelihood of selecting a broadcast join based
              codepath over a shuffle based join. Concretely, dask will select a broadcast based join
              algorithm if small_table.npartitions < log2(big_table.npartitions) * broadcast_bias
              Note: Forcing a broadcast join might lead to perf issues or OOM errors in cases where the
              broadcasted table is too large to fit on a single worker.

      limit:
        type: object
        properties:

          check-first-partition:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Whether or not to check the first partition length when computing a LIMIT without an OFFSET
              on a table with a relatively simple Dask graph (i.e. only IO and/or partition-wise layers);
              checking partition length triggers a Dask graph computation which can be slow for complex
              queries, but can signicantly reduce memory usage when querying a small subset of a large
              table. Default is ``true``.

      optimize:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether the first generated logical plan should be further optimized or used as is.

      predicate_pushdown:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether to try pushing down filter predicates into IO (when possible).

      sort:
        type: object
        properties:

          topk-nelem-limit:
            type: integer
            description: |
              Total number of elements below which dask-sql should attempt to apply the top-k
              optimization (when possible). ``nelem`` is defined as the limit or ``k`` value times the
              number of columns. Default is 1000000, corresponding to a LIMIT clause of 1 million in a
              1 column table.
