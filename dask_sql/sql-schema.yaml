          check-first-partition:
            type: boolean
            description: |
              Whether or not to check the first partition length when computing a LIMIT without an OFFSET
              on a table with a relatively simple Dask graph (i.e. only IO and/or partition-wise layers);
              checking partition length triggers a Dask graph computation which can be slow for complex
              queries, but can signicantly reduce memory usage when querying a small subset of a large
              table. Default is ``true``.

      predicate_pushdown:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether to try pushing down filter predicates into IO (when possible).
